On this GPT Project I have applied Next.Js, css modules, and integrated with Open AI API in order to make ChatGpt 3.5 show sentences for the user in Portuguese
in order to make him or her able to translate to English with also the Gpt correcting work. The API Key is being ignored by gitignore, but everything I have done
to make the project works, it available publicly.
